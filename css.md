## Introduction
There are many projects out there using different preprocessors and some which don't use any preprocessors. Here we shall link to our own rules and the style guides that belong to SASS / LESS and any preprocessor that is used in the future.

## Avoid using IDs for any styling
An ID should only be used once per page. So using them for styling is not suitable, as the CSS is less likely to be reusable.

## SASS 
SASS style guide is covered [here](/coding-standards/sass).

## LESS
There are not currently any standards set in stone by Netmatters.
